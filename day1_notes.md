# 🧠 Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) and RAG

## 📌 What is an LLM?

- **LLM** stands for **Large Language Model**.
- It is a type of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that can understand and generate text like a human.
- Examples: **ChatGPT**, **Bard**, **Claude**.

---

## 🤖 How Do LLMs Work?

- LLMs work based on **probabilities**.
- Given some words (called **tokens**), they **predict the next word**.
- These models are trained on a **huge amount of text** from books, websites, and articles.

### 🧮 Behind the Scenes:

- Text is broken into **tokens** (small parts of words).
- These tokens are converted into **numbers (vectors)**.
- The model uses **mathematics (matrices and attention mechanisms)** to understand and generate text.

---

## ⚙️ LLM Architecture Basics

### Encoder-Decoder (used in some models):

- **Encoder**: Understands the input text.
- **Self-Attention**: Helps the model focus on important words.
- **Decoder**: Produces the output (like an answer or summary).

> Note: ChatGPT uses a decoder-only transformer, but understanding encoder-decoder helps.

## 🌟 What Can LLMs Do?

- Answer questions
- Write summaries
- Translate text
- Create content
- Help with coding
- Chat with users

---

## ⚠️ Limitations of LLMs

- May **hallucinate** (make things up).
- Don’t always have **latest information**.
- Cannot **cite sources**.
- Can’t access your **private or confidential data** unless given.
- Answers are based on **training data**, not real-time web search.

---

# 🔍 What is RAG?

## 📌 RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- A technique that **improves LLMs** by giving them access to external knowledge.
- Used when we want the model to answer based on **private data or latest documents**.

---

## 🔧 How Does RAG Work?

1. **User asks a question**.
2. The question is **converted to vectors** using an **embedding model**.
3. At the same time, your documents are also **converted to vectors** and stored in a **vector database**.
4. RAG searches this database to find the most **relevant info**.
5. That info is then passed along with the question to the **LLM**.
6. The LLM uses both the **question** and the **retrieved info** to generate an answer.

---

## 🧠 Why Use RAG?

- It helps the LLM give **more accurate and updated answers**.
- You can include your **own custom data**.
- It reduces **hallucination** by giving real context.

---

## 📦 Components Used in RAG

- **Embedding Models**:
  - Convert text into numbers.
  - Examples: OpenAI embeddings, HuggingFace models, Nomadic, etc.

- **Vector Database**:
  - Stores text in a format that makes it easy to search.
  - Examples: Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate.

- **Retriever**:
  - Finds relevant info from the database.

- **Generator (LLM)**:
  - Creates the final answer based on the retrieved info.

---

## 🔁 RAG Workflow Summary

1. Load your custom data (like PDFs, docs).
2. Convert it into embeddings and store in a vector database.
3. When a query is asked:
   - It is also embedded and compared to stored data.
   - The most relevant content is retrieved.
4. The LLM then uses that context to give a better answer.

---

## ✅ Summary

- LLMs are powerful but can make mistakes.
- RAG helps LLMs by adding **relevant, real-world info** from **your own data**.
- Together, they make AI **more useful**, **accurate**, and **personalized**.

# 🧠 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) & LLMs — Beginner Notes

---

## 📌 Overview

- **RAG** is an **AI framework** that improves **LLMs** (Large Language Models) by adding relevant external knowledge.
- LLMs are **generative models** that create responses based on what they've learned.
- RAG allows LLMs to work with **custom and real-time data** by using components like:
  - Retriever
  - Generator
  - Ranker
  - External Data (Knowledge Base)

---

## 🔧 Components of RAG

### 1. **Retriever**
- Searches external knowledge bases (like documents, PDFs, audio transcripts, etc.)
- Finds the **most relevant data** based on the user's query.

### 2. **Ranker**
- Ranks the retrieved information based on **how closely it matches the user's query**.
- Filters out the best possible context.

### 3. **Generator**
- Uses the retrieved and ranked content to **generate a clear and structured response**.
- Powered by an **LLM** like GPT or Gemini.

## 💬 Prompt

- A **prompt** is the **input or question** given by a user to the model.
- The quality of the prompt affects the accuracy and relevance of the output.

## 🧠 LLMs vs RAG

| Feature             | LLMs                      | RAG                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Nature              | Pretrained models          | A concept/framework                       |
| Data Source         | Fixed training data        | Real-time, external knowledge             |
| Customization       | Hard to adapt quickly      | Easy to plug in custom data               |
| Use Case            | General-purpose generation | Domain-specific, real-time generation     |
| Cost/Training       | High for fine-tuning       | Low (uses existing embeddings)            |
| Example             | GPT-4, Claude, Bard        | RAG-based apps like Gemini Pro            |

## 📊 Vector Embeddings

- **Embedding** = Converting text into **numerical vector form**.
- Necessary because **machines understand only numbers** (binary 1s and 0s).
- Each word/sentence gets mapped to a **position in vector space** (like on a 3D map).

### 🧭 Example:
- "King" and "Queen" will be placed **differently** in vector space.
- "Male" will be **closer to King**, while "Queen" might be further as it's a different gender.
- If you ask about a movie like *"Mission Impossible"*, the model will retrieve **similar embeddings** from the vector space.

---

## 🗂️ External Dataset (Knowledge Base)

- These are documents **you provide** to the system (private data).
- Can include:
  - PDFs
  - YouTube transcripts
  - Audio files
  - Text files
  - Images (with captions or OCR)

- These are converted to **embeddings** and stored in a **Vector Database** (like Pinecone or FAISS).

---

## 🧮 Vector Database

- Stores the **vector embeddings** of your custom data.
- Makes it easy for the **retriever** to find relevant information.
- Can store at:
  - Word level
  - Sentence level
  - Document level

- Example tools: **ElasticSearch**, **FAISS**, **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**

---

## 🔁 RAG Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. **User asks a question** (prompt).
2. Question is **converted to vector** using an **embedding model**.
3. The vector is used to **search the vector database**.
4. **Retriever** finds the most relevant data.
5. **Ranker** ranks the best-matched context.
6. **LLM** (generator) takes the query + retrieved context and **generates a response**.
7. The response is **sent back to the user**.

## 🤖 RAG vs Fine-Tuning (Very Important)

| Feature         | Fine-Tuning                                   | RAG                                               |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| What it does    | Retrains a model with new data                 | Adds new knowledge **without retraining**         |
| Cost            | High (needs resources, time, task-specific data) | Low (uses existing embeddings and database)      |
| Flexibility     | Fixed model after tuning                       | Highly flexible with updates                      |
| Best for        | Precise, domain-specific, large-data needs     | Real-time, dynamic, smaller data needs            |
| Risk            | Less hallucination with good training          | Might hallucinate if embeddings are irrelevant    |
| Use case        | Finance, Healthcare (strict domain use)        | Customer support, FAQ bots, fast deployment       |
